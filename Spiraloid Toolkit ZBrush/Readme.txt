WARNING:
this is my personal workflow setup, no support, liability or warranty should be assumed.  I'm just sharing my setup.  if it breaks yours.  bummer.  be warned.

Usage:
this creates a spiraloid menu that is bound the "u" hotkey.  
I suggest mapping this key to the right click on your mouse and wacom pen.  
you should never have to press zadd mrgb etc.
press setup in top right each time you start to reset camera behavior and initialize settings.  it also activates a timelapse.
press nuke in top right to erase the polypaint and flood the current subtool with 50% gray.


Installation:
-extract the "Spiraloid" folder in this location.  C:\Program Files\Pixologic\ZBrush 4R8\ZStartup\Macros\
-restart zbrush.
-Press menu macros > "Reload all Macros".
-Press menu macros > Spiraloid > "_______________Install_______________"  button at the bottom.
-Press preferences > Config > "Store Config" (assuming you want to keep using it after restarting ZB)
-Press preferences > Hotkeys > "Store Hotkeys" (assuming you want to keep using it after restarting ZB)


Caveats:

changes from the default hotkeys:

ctrl d : deselects mask
ctrl h : hides mask
ctrl i : inverts mask
shift c : frames tool
ctrl e : merges subtool down.
shift F :  toggles wireframe and solo at the same time. super useful for live boolean object editing.
f : toggle wireframe
1 : flat shade
2 : preview render 
3 : render 
4 : clay shade 
5 : pewter shade 
5 : toon shade
