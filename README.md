# Spiraloid-Toolkit-for-Zbrush
Custom UI, hotkeys and colors for Zbrush 4R8


WARNING:

this is my personal workflow setup, no support, liability or warranty should be assumed.  I'm just sharing my setup.  if it breaks yours.  bummer.  be warned.

Usage:

this creates a spiraloid menu that is bound the "u" hotkey.  
I suggest mapping this key to the back button on your mouse and a wacom pen side button. 

once installed, you should never have to press zadd mrgb etc.  if you need to, it's still availiable on right click or spacebar.

press setup in top right each time you open a project to reset camera behavior, initialize settings and activates a timelapse recording.

press nuke in top right to erase the polypaint and flood the current subtool with 50% gray and material.


Installation:
-extract the "Spiraloid" folder in this location.  C:\Program Files\Pixologic\ZBrush 4R8\ZStartup\Macros\

-restart zbrush.

-Press menu macros > "Reload all Macros".

-Press menu macros > Spiraloid > "_______________Install_______________"  button at the bottom.

-Press preferences > Config > "Store Config" (assuming you want to keep using it after restarting ZB)

-Press preferences > Hotkeys > "Store Hotkeys" (assuming you want to keep using it after restarting ZB)



Caveats:

everybutton is a macro with varying levels of zScripting in them and has been tuned from years of use.

changes from the default hotkeys:

ctrl d : deselects mask

ctrl h : hides mask

ctrl i : inverts mask

shift c : frames tool

ctrl e : merges subtool down.

shift F :  toggles wireframe and solo at the same time. super useful for live boolean object editing.

f : toggle wireframe

1 : flat shade

2 : preview render 

3 : render 

4 : clay shade 

5 : pewter shade 

6 : toon shade
